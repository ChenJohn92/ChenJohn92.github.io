## A starting blog (About Markdown language)
Recently, I have moved to use the jekyll system to write my blogs. Using the jekyll blog system is of great fun. I have also learn a little bit about the markdown system for webpage writing. It seems really interesting. I think maybe in this blog I will show a simple tutorial about markdown webpage. 

### What is Markdown Language?
First, the markdown is a kind of markup language. It uses some simple marks to replace the complicated webpage language. Writers can focus more on writing the blogs and words instead of waste too much time on changing the front-end pages. It is a simple but very powerful system. 

### How it works? 

how it works? yes, this is the key concern for people. You only have to write some simple marks to replace the headings or in html. 

Let me make an example,

if I want to write a pretty heading in webpage like heading4, the appearance will be :

#### heading4
	
	the html code will be <h4>heading4</h4>
	to use markdown, you only have to write #### heading4 

and you are good to go!
