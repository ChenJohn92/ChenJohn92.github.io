### Learning Image and User Features for Recommendation in Social Networks

This is a paper published in ICCV, the paper is to find a good representation for Image + user features. I think this is related to what we currently facing. So, they think the challenge is that for traditional recommender systems, learning representative features of combining user and images is hard. In particular, social curation networks are always sparse, so it will affect the recommendation result. And to address the challenges, they use a deep neural network, learning the unified feature representations for users and images. The key is to transform the heterogeneous user-image networks to homogeneous representations. 

From the introductoin, they present two challenges: 

 - The *extreme sparsity* of network structure
 - The *extreme diversity* of multimedia contents. 

They believe that the diversity will make data not easy to categorized. 
So they proposed a novel feature learning approach for recommendation. The goal of paper is like this:

It show that, firstly, we need a social-curation network. And build the graph based on user-image interations. Then, generates the output. Here. red is use, blue is image. so there is an interaction. As is figure(c), they hope the representatoin can be: 1 close to $A_0$, 3 close to $A_1$. Everyone close to the image they have. 

Their model is a deep learning framework, they break down the network topology into a tree-strucured deep hierarchy. 

And, the problem definition part of this paper is long and verbose, I don't want to write too many. Key point is, firstly, recommend contents by similarity of features, and then, the modularity is talking about the restriction for situation when nodes are linking with only a very small set of nodes, or things realted. 

So, let's head to the architecture of the paper. 

**Deep Learning for Social Networks**

Firstly, what they proposed is a hierarchical deep model. Similar to the Hierarchical softmax, the paper use the huffman tree to do the job, they let $n_i(m)$ be the $m$-th node on the path from root to $i$, and $L_i$ is the length of path. So, the hierarchical softmax version of $p(i|j)$ is:

$$p(i|j) = \prod_{m=1}^{L_i-1}\delta(I[n_i(m)]\cdot x_{n_i(m)}^T x_j)$$

The hierarchical softmax is mainly used for compute the complexity of $n$ sums. 

So the hierarchical softmax architecture is firstly sampled from random walks, and then build the hierarchical trees, and then use the deep network to train. 

the illustration of deep architecture for social network is like this:

So, the firstly we will encode the topology information of network by using random walk. Like, the shared parameters correspond to the overlaps of routes. 

The route to the vertex $i$ is by way of vertex $j$. The shared nodes will encode the path information. All nodes are encoded with a hierarchy topology. 

The, the difference between a traditional deep neural network and this paper is that tradition only uses the hidden units' content, this paper uses all contents. 

**So, there are formulation**

if we want to recommending images *i* to a user *u*, the math is :

$$\max_{X_u,X_i} p(u|i) or p(i, u)~~~ \text{if u likes}\ i $$

$$\min_{X_u,X_i} p(u|i) or p(i, u)~~~ \text{if u dislikes} \ i$$

Also, they transform the DCNN to the feature space: $x_i = CNN(i)$. So image will use a feature vector to represent, and the overall objective function will be the sum of user $i, j$ image vector plus the user $i, j$ network vector. 

For a typical social curation network, the algorithm need parallelization, but the parallelization is always hard for CNN's parameter is sharing by all the pairs, so the paper gives a solution to solve the parallelization problem. The algorithm can be like this:
