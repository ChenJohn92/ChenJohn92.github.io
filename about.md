My name is **Yujun Chen**, and this is my personal blog. It currently has {{ site.posts | size }} posts in {{ site.categories | size }} categories which combinedly have {{ total_words }} words, which will take an average reader ({{ site.wpm }} WPM) approximately <span class="time">{{ total_readtime }}</span> minutes to read. 

{% if featuredcount != 0 %}There are <a href="{{ site.url }}/featured">{{ featuredcount }} featured posts</a>, you should definitely check those out.{% endif %} The most recent post is {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% if post.description %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}" title="Read more about {{ post.title }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} which was published on {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% assign modifiedtime = post.modified | date: "%Y%m%d" %}{% assign posttime = post.date | date: "%Y%m%d" %}<time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-time">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% if post.modified %}{% if modifiedtime != posttime %} and last modified on <time datetime="{{ post.modified | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ post.modified | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}. The last commit was on {{ site.time | date: "%A, %d %b %Y" }} at {{ site.time | date: "%I:%M %p" }} [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Temps Universel Coordonn√©").

I am an PhD student in *Computer Science* at the [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/). 
My research interest is machine learning and Ubiquitous Data Mining, I also do a little bit Computer Vision Projects in my Early studies(2013~2015). 

I was born and brought up in Nanchang, capital city of Jiangxi Province, China. It's a province in the southeast of China. A beautiful, less polluted city. 

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, I hope to found a self-sustaining collective of clever people, for fun, profit(?), and the promotion of human life in the universe. This might wind up in Beijing, Shanghai and many other cities. The most challenging aspect of this concept is to curtail unproductive competition with other people who will inevitably have the same idea. (Some sort of cooperative federation...) I'm presently looking for people who might be interested in being a part of such an organization.

Anyways, for now I'm just working toward make the world better, by analyzing or prediction. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.
